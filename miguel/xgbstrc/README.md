# Node classification with structural properties

This model aim to help testing whether the structural (or topological)
properties of a graph are useful to predict node types (node classification)
using supervised machine learning techniques. The algorithm use an
implementation of XGBoost and the SMOTE sampling technique.

The **parameters** required for the algorithm are:

| parameter | description |
|---|---|
|  |  |

The **outputs** are:

# Examples

## Example1

The example illustrate how the model can be used to check if the structural
properties of the gene co-expression network improve the prediction of gene
functions for rice (*Oryza sativa Japonica*).

In this case, the whole gene co-expression network is used.
