\section*{Availability of data and materials}%% if any
The datasets analysed during the current study are publicy available. They can be found in the following locations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Human interactome information was retrieved of the supplementary files included in ~\cite{Kovacs2019}.
\item Rice Interactomes were downloaded from STRING database of protein interactions (4530.protein.links.detailed.v11.0.txt).
Only interactions which have a curated origin (meaning a value different than zero on the column \emph{'databases'})
\end{itemize}
