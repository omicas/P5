Herein, we describe an updated version of ATTED-II, which expands this resource to include additional agriculturally important plants. To improve the quality of the coexpression data for Arabidopsis and rice, we included more gene expression data from microarray and RNA sequencing studies. The RNA sequencing-based coexpression data now cover 94\\% of the Arabidopsis protein-encoding genes, representing a substantial increase from previously available microarray-based coexpression data (76\\% coverage). We also generated coexpression data for four dicots (soybean, poplar, grape and alfalfa) and one monocot (maize). As both the quantity and quality of expression data for the non-model species are generally poorer than for the model species, we verified coexpression data associated with these new species using multiple methods. First, the overall performance of the coexpression data was evaluated using gene ontology annotations and the coincidence of a genomic feature. Secondly, the reliability of each guide gene was determined by comparing coexpressed gene lists between platforms. With the expanded and newly evaluated coexpression data, ATTED-II represents an important resource for identifying functionally related genes in agriculturally important plants.}},

As an advanced coexpression analysis method, multispecies comparisons have the potential to detect alterations in gene relationships within an evolutionary context. However, determining the validity of comparative coexpression studies is difficult without quantitative assessments of the quality of coexpression data. ATTED-II (version 9) provides 16 coexpression platforms for nine plant species, including seven species supported by both microarray- and RNA sequencing (RNAseq)-based coexpression data. Two independent sources of coexpression data enable the assessment of the reproducibility of coexpression. The latest coexpression data for Arabidopsis (Ath-m.c7-1 and Ath-r.c3-0) showed the highest reproducibility (Jaccard coefficient = 0.13) among previous coexpression data in ATTED-II. We also investigated the statistical basis of the mutual rank (MR) index as a coexpression measure by bootstrap sampling of experimental units. We found that the error distribution of the logit-transformed MR index showed normality with equal variances for each coexpression platform. Because the MR error was strongly correlated with the number of samples for the coexpression data, typical confidence intervals for the MR index can be estimated for any coexpression platform. These new, high-quality coexpression data can be analyzed with any tool in ATTED-II and combined with external resources to obtain insight into plant biology.}},

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

  abstract  = {Proteins and their functional interactions form the backbone of the cellular machinery. Their connectivity network needs to be considered for the full understanding of biological phenomena, but the available information on protein-protein associations is incomplete and exhibits varying levels of annotation granularity and reliability. The STRING database aims to collect, score and integrate all publicly available sources of protein-protein interaction information, and to complement these with computational predictions. Its goal is to achieve a comprehensive and objective global network, including direct (physical) as well as indirect (functional) interactions. The latest version of STRING (11.0) more than doubles the number of organisms it covers, to 5090. The most important new feature is an option to upload entire, genome-wide datasets as input, allowing users to visualize subsets as interaction networks and to perform gene-set enrichment analysis on the entire input. For the enrichment analysis, STRING implements well-known classification systems such as Gene Ontology and KEGG, but also offers additional, new classification systems based on high-throughput text-mining as well as on a hierarchical clustering of the association network itself. The STRING resource is available online at https://string-db.org/.},

abstract="Proteins often do not function as single substances but rather as team players in a dynamic network. Growing evidence shows that protein--protein interactions are crucial in many biological processes in living cells. Genetic (such as yeast two-hybrid, Y2H) and biochemical (such as co-immunoprecipitation, co-IP) methods are the methods commonly used at the beginning of a study to identify the interacting proteins. Immunoprecipitation (IP), a method using a target protein-specific antibody in conjunction with Protein A/G affinity beads, is a powerful tool to identify molecules that interact with specific proteins. Therefore, co-IP is considered to be one of the standard methods of identifying or confirming the occurrence of protein--protein interaction events in vivo. Co-IP experiments can identify proteins via direct or indirect interactions or in a protein complex. Here, we use Agrobacterium type VI secretion system (T6SS) sheath components TssB-TssC41 interaction as an example to describe the principle, procedure, and experimental problems of co-IP.",

  abstract  = {Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are a family of extracellular glycoproteins implicated in plant growth and development. With a rapid growth in the number of genomes sequenced in many plant species, the family members of AGPs can now be predicted to facilitate functional investigation. Building upon previous advances in identifying Arabidopsis AGPs, an integrated strategy of systematical AGP screening for "classical" and "chimeric" family members is proposed in this study. A Python script named Finding-AGP is compiled to find AGP-like sequences and filter AGP candidates under the given thresholds. The primary screening of classical AGPs, Lys-rich classical AGPs, AGP-extensin hybrids, and non-classical AGPs was performed using the existence of signal peptides as a necessary requirement, and BLAST searches were conducted mainly for fasciclin-like, phytocyanin-like and xylogen-like AGPs. Then glycomodule index and partial PAST (Pro, Ala, Ser, and Thr) percentage are adopted to identify AGP candidates. The integrated strategy successfully discovered AGP gene families in 47 plant species and the main results are summarized as follows: (i) AGPs are abundant in angiosperms and many "ancient" AGPs with Ser-Pro repeats are found in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; (ii) Classical AGPs, AG-peptides, and Lys-rich classical AGPs first emerged in Physcomitrella patens, Selaginella moellendorffii, and Picea abies, respectively; (iii) Nine subfamilies of chimeric AGPs are introduced as newly identified chimeric subfamilies similar to fasciclin-like, phytocyanin-like, and xylogen-like AGPs; (iv) The length and amino acid composition of Lys-rich domains are largely variable, indicating an insertion/deletion model during evolution. Our findings provide not only a powerful means to identify AGP gene families but also probable explanations of AGPs in maintaining the plant cell wall and transducing extracellular signals into the cytoplasm.},

  abstract = {Summary Many secretory and several vacuolar proteins in higher plants contain hydroxylated proline residues. In many cases, hydroxyprolines in proteins are glycosylated with either arabinogalactan or oligoarabinose. We have previously shown that a sporamin precursor is O-glycosylated at the hydroxylated proline 36 residue with an arabinogalactan-type glycan when this protein is expressed in tobacco BY-2 cells (Matsuoka etÂ al., 1995). Taking advantage of the fact that this is the only site of proline hydroxylation and glycosylation in sporamin, we analyzed the amino acid requirement for proline hydroxylation and arabinogalactosylation. We expressed several deletion constructs and many amino acid substitution mutants in tobacco cells and analyzed glycosylation and proline hydroxylation of the expressed sporamins. Hydroxylation of a proline residue requires the five amino acid sequence [AVSTG]â€“Proâ€“[AVSTGA]â€“[GAVPSTC]â€“[APS or acidic] (where Pro is the modification site) and glycosylation of hydroxyproline (Hyp) requires the seven amino acid sequence [not basic]â€“[not T]â€“[neither P, T, nor amide]â€“Hypâ€“[neither amide nor P]â€“[not amide]â€“[APST], although charged amino acids at the âˆ’2 position and basic amide residues at the +1 position relative to the modification site seem to inhibit the elongation of the arabinogalactan side chain. Based on the combination of these two requirements, we concluded that the sequence motif for efficient arabinogalactosylation, including the elongation of the glycan side chain, is [not basic]â€“[not T]â€“[AVSG]â€“Proâ€“[AVST]â€“[GAVPSTC]â€“[APS].},

  abstract               = {We show here that the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF), which has been shown to be a mitogen for breast cancer cells, also stimulates cell survival through a distinct signaling pathway. Breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47-D, BT-20, and MDA-MB-231) were found to express both types of NGF receptors: p140(trkA) and p75(NTR). The two other tyrosine kinase receptors for neurotrophins, TrkB and TrkC, were not expressed. The mitogenic effect of NGF on breast cancer cells required the tyrosine kinase activity of p140(trkA) as well as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, but was independent of p75(NTR). In contrast, the anti-apoptotic effect of NGF (studied using the ceramide analogue C2) required p75(NTR) as well as the activation of the transcription factor NF-kB, but neither p140(trkA) nor MAPK was necessary. Other neurotrophins (BDNF, NT-3, NT-4/5) also induced cell survival, although not proliferation, emphasizing the importance of p75(NTR) in NGF-mediated survival. Both the pharmacological NF-kappaB inhibitor SN50, and cell transfection with IkBm, resulted in a diminution of NGF anti-apoptotic effect. These data show that two distinct signaling pathways are required for NGF activity and confirm the roles played by p75(NTR) and NF-kappaB in the activation of the survival pathway in breast cancer cells.},

Based on the guilt-by-association principle, our approach (called SANTA) quantifies the strength of association between a gene set and a network, and functionally annotates molecular networks like other enrichment methods annotate lists of genes. As a general association measure, SANTA can (i) functionally annotate experimentally derived networks using a collection of curated gene sets and (ii) annotate experimentally derived gene sets using a collection of curated networks, as well as (iii) prioritize genes for follow-up analyses. We exemplify the efficacy of SANTA in several case studies using the S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network and genome-wide RNAi screens in cancer cell lines. Our theory, simulations, and applications show that SANTA provides a principled statistical way to quantify the association between molecular networks and cellular functions and phenotypes.

The unique stromal-epithelial interactions, and more generally, microenvironmental features of basal-like breast cancers have not been well characterized. To identify characteristic microenvironment features of basal-like breast cancer, we performed cocultures of several basal-like breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts and compared these with cocultures of luminal breast cancer cell lines with fibroblasts. Interactions between basal-like cancer cells and fibroblasts induced expression of numerous interleukins and chemokines, including IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, CXCL3, and TGFÎ². Under the influence of fibroblasts, basal-like breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in vitro. Migration was less pronounced for luminal lines; but, these lines were more likely to have altered proliferation. These differences were relevant to tumor biology in vivo, as the gene set that distinguished luminal and basal-like stromal interactions in coculture also distinguishes basal-like from luminal tumors with 98% accuracy in 10-fold cross-validation and 100% accuracy in an independent test set. However, comparisons between cocultures where cells were in direct contact and cocultures where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct cell-to-cell contact. The phenotypes and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with fibroblasts support the microenvironment and cell-cell interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer subtypes.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in gene expression are key events in disease etiology and risk. Poor reproducibility in detecting differentially expressed genes across studies suggests individual genes may not be sufficiently informative for complex diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI). Rather, dysregulation of the 'molecular network' may be critical for pathogenic processes. Such a dynamic network can be built from pairwise non-linear interactions. RESULTS: We investigate non-linear interactions represented in mRNA expression profiles that integrate genetic background and environmental factors. Using logistic regression, we test the association of individual GWAS-based candidate genes and non-linear interaction terms (between these mRNA expression levels) with MI. Based on microarray data in CATHGEN (CATHeterization in GENetics) and FHS (Framingham Heart Study), we find individual genes and pairs of mRNAs, encoded by 41 MI candidate genes, with significant interaction terms in the logistic regression model. Two pairs replicate between CATHGEN and FHS (CNNM2|GUCY1A3 and CNNM2|ZEB2). Analysis of RNAseq data from GTEx (Genotype-Tissue Expression) shows that 20Â % of these disease-associated RNA pairs are co-expressed, further prioritizing significant interactions. Because edges in sparse co-expression networks formed solely by the 41 candidate genes are unlikely to represent direct physical interactions, we identify additional RNAs as links between network pairs of candidate genes. This approach reveals additional mRNAs and interaction terms significant in the context of MI, for example, the path CNNM2|ACSL5|SCARF1|GUCY1A3, characterized by the common themes of magnesium and lipid processing. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support a role for non-linear interactions between genes in MI and provide a basis for further study of MI systems biology. mRNA expression profiles encoded by a limited number of candidate genes yield sparse networks of MI-relevant interactions that can be expanded to include additional candidates by co-expression analysis. The non-linear interactions observed here inform our understanding of the clinical relevance of gene-gene interactions in the pathophysiology of MI, while providing a new strategy in developing clinical biomarker panels.},
